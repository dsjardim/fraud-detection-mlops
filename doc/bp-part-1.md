# MLOps: A Complete Introduction

Machine Learning Operations (MLOps) refers to the tools, techniques and practical experiences required to train  machine learning models and deploy and monitor them in production.

The concept of MLOps comes from DevOps, which is the existing practice of more efficiently write, deploy, and manage enterprise applications. It was designed to unite software developers (Devs) and IT operations teams (Ops) to enable better collaboration between them. MLOps shares these aims but adds the Data Scientists and also ML Engineers to the team. 

MLOps became popular due to the rise of the Data Science and Machine Learning areas in the past years. The reason for that is that Data Scientists have a strong background in statistics and programming, but they are not used to put ML models into production. This is where ML Engineers comes into picture, they have the knowledge of databases, REST APIs, and a collection of other IT skills that are needed to accomplish this task.

## The benefits and challenges of MLOps


### How to implement MLOps:

There are three levels to be covered:
1. Level 0 - Manual Processes
2. Level 1 - ML Pipeline Automation
3. Level 2 - CI/CD Pipeline Automation

## MLOps Tools
Data/Model pipelines: DVC, Kubeflow, MLflow
CI/CD: CML, GitHub Actions, Jenkins
Cloud: AWS, GCP and Azure

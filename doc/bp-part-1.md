# MLOps: A Complete Introduction

Machine Learning Operations (MLOps) is modeled on DevOps, the existing practice of more efficiently writing, deploying, and managing enterprise applications. 
DevOps began as a way to unite software developers (Devs) and IT operations teams (Ops), destroying data silos and enabling better collaboration.

MLOps shares these aims but adds the Data Scientists and also ML Engineers to the team. 
Therefore, the main idea of this is to establish best practices about developing ML pipelines and also to automate as much as possible regarding the machine learning lifecycle.

## MLOps vs DevOps



## The importance and benefits of MLOps

### How to implement MLOps:

There are three levels to be covered:
1. Level 0 - Manual Processes
2. Level 1 - ML Pipeline Automation
3. Level 2 - CI/CD Pipeline Automation

## MLOps Tools
Data/Model pipelines: DVC, Kubeflow, MLflow
CI/CD: CML, GitHub Actions, Jenkins
Cloud: AWS, GCP and Azure
